Cycleformers is available on PyPi:

```bash
pip install cycleformers
```

The module has only been tested on Linux. I have no plans to support Windows or MacOS at this time.

## Development Setup

To build the module locally for development and bugfixing, I recommend the following command which initialises a .env, runs poetry install and sets up the pre-commit hooks:

```bash
make init
```
